# Planit Poker
### Branches
- Each team member should create their own local branch and work on it
- If / when we need to merge these things together, then make a pull request and it will be reviewed before merging

### Blackboard
- The blackboard class is going to hold all of the information that will be public to all components
- ex) I want to show the cards given that I have the ***formatting scheme***
    - this ***formatting scheme*** will be a variable that is in the class that is created
    - I am guessing that this must be a static variable
- You should create the needed getters and setters for the variables that you create 
- You should always assign a useable default value to your created value 
- To use this, create an instance of this in the main function and pass this in as a parameter to your new component
